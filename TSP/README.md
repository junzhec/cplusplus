This project solves the problem of Travelling Salesman.

The program first ask user how many cities to be considered. Then it will generate a matrix that contains city name and distance between each city.
For example, the matrix may looks like following:
x   a   b   c   d
a   x   20  42  35
b   20  x   30  34
c   42  30  x   12
d   35  34  12  x
